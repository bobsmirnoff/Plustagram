Plustagram
==========

An Android application that serves to put plusses to people, objects and events.
No server is intended by the project phylosophy.
Though anyone aiming to provide one is welcome:)

The code is so simple, it doesn't need instructions, imo. There is a welcoming Activity, a Main Activity with entry list and an Activity to manage each entry.
There also is a SQLite database to store info about plusses and comment/date info about each of them.
